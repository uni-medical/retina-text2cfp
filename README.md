# RetinaLogos: Fine-Grained Synthesis of High-Resolution Retinal Images Through Captions

This Repo presents the implementation of **RetinaLogos: Fine-Grained Synthesis of High-Resolution Retinal Images Through Captions**, a novel method designed to generate high-resolution Color Fundus Photographs (CFPs) from textual descriptions of retinal conditions. Our method addresses the limitations of existing retinal image synthesis models by providing more detailed and fine-grained control over anatomical structures and disease progression using large-scale text-to-image generation techniques.

## üåü Abstract

- **Why Ours Is Important?**  
  ![Model Architecture](scr/teaser.png)

The scarcity of high-quality, labeled retinal imaging data presents a significant challenge in ophthalmology. In this work, we introduce **RetinaLogos**, a groundbreaking text-to-image framework that utilizes a large-scale synthetic caption dataset (1.4 million entries) to generate high-resolution retinal images. Our approach combines Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with multimodal text generation, enabling fine-grained semantic control over the generated images. **RetinaLogos** can synthesize retinal images that capture subtle anatomical variations and disease progression, providing valuable insights for early detection and clinical training purposes. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, achieving a 10%-25% improvement in classification tasks such as diabetic retinopathy grading and glaucoma detection.

## üí° Highlights 

- **Large-Scale Synthetic Dataset**: We have developed **RetinaLogos-1400k**, a synthetic dataset containing 1.4 million retinal caption-image pairs. This enables the generation of high-resolution, clinically relevant Color Fundus Photographs (CFPs) across a wide range of retinal conditions.

- **Fine-Grained Control Over Retinal Images**: RetinaLogos allows for precise control over retinal anatomical structures and disease stages using free-form textual prompts, providing unprecedented customization for lesion types, disease progression, and anatomical variations.

- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: RetinaLogos demonstrates superior performance in generating clinically accurate retinal images. 62.07% of text-driven synthetic images are indistinguishable from real ones by ophthalmologists, with significant improvements (10%-25%) in diabetic retinopathy grading and glaucoma detection.
